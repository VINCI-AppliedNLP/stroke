NIH STROKE SCORE: 16

==================

Impression: improving left posterior MCA stroke

NIH stroke score = 9
Barthel score = 50
Modified Rankin = 4

=========================

CPT code:
Stroke (ICD-9-CM 436.) (Primary)

=================

A/P:
59 y/o RH WM s/p MI and CABG had sudden onset R hemiparesis and aphasia
this morning.  He recovered from the aphasia but still has mild right
hemiparesis.  No aphasia was noted at the moment.  With the history of
recent GI bleeding and the NIH Stroke Score of 1, he is not a candidate
for TPA.

=======================





NIH STROKE SCORE: 1 (mild right lower face weakness)

Head CT: no evidence of acute bleed or infarct.


===============

STATION/GAIT- Unable to access

NIH stroke score: 11
Alert - 0
Incorrect Month, age- 2

===============

Factor V leiden mutation, elevated
anticardiolipin IgM, and possible stroke 1/08; who was transferred from OSH for
management of L MCA stroke.

================

no tremor,
ftn wnl.
stroke score 1 due to aphasia only, has trouble with more than 3-4 word
sentenses but this is much better than 20min ago when had almost complete
aphasia.

================

2. New diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.  Since there's no known time of
initiation, we do no recommend direct current cardioversion due to risk of
stroke.  Also, this may delay the diagnosis of the syncope.  He's asymptomatic
and his rate is controlled.  His stroke score is low (0) so no anticoagulation
is needed (aspirin 325 mg PO daily is adequate).

===========================


 
OBJECTIVE: Alert, Ox4, no acute distress, VSS. Stroke score is 0. FAST score 
is 0. Vet verbalized that when supine, "the room was spinning". States he had 
similar episode last week.

=======================

4.  History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, CHADS2 (congestive heart
    failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke) score equals 5,
    controlled on digoxin.  
	
	====================

	SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1.  Atrial fibrillation on lifelong warfarin.  CHADS (congestive heart
    failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke) score equals 3.
	
	============================
	
	SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:  
1.  Atrial flutter, CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age,
    diabetes, stroke) score of  2.
2.  Coronary artery disease. 

========================

Head CT was negative, there was also no significant 
stenosis of his carotids or intracranial vessels.Initial stroke score was 3 and 
TPA was not recommended.On re evaluation of patient's c/o, his left arm was 
better and symptoms improved. Patient was admitted to SCU with Neurology 
consult.

=========================================
STROKE RISK/ CHADS2 Score:  +Age,+HTN,+DM, -recent CHF, -Stroke:  Score: 3
Cardiac Risk Factors include:
DMII, HTN, and dyslipidemia (no recent lipid profile)

=========================================

 No slurred speech no headache no shortness of 
breath. At my initial evaluation patient did have a positive Cincinnati 
prehospital Stroke score and a "stroke alert" and ordered the patient to be 
immediately transferred to CT
Past medical history:reviewed in chart

========================================


the patient had left sided weakness and 
slurred speech which was not present prior to when she went into the shower. 
Patient denies any chest pain pressure. Patient had a Cincinnati prehospital 
stroke score of 2 and a NIH stroke score of 8. Immediately upon arrival to the 
emergency room I called a stroke alert and patient was sent to CAT scan.
Past medical history:reviewed in chart

==========================

The patient 
was evaluated for stroke risk related to his atrial fibrillation and 
found to be a CHADS risk stroke score of 0. 

==========================

 He underwent mechanical thrombectomy, which successfully 
recanalized the artery, bringing his NIH stroke score from 15 to 7. He was 
admitted to the neurology stroke service for further workup.

================================


1. Right MCA stroke; stroke score 4 upon admission.

 pt presents with a possible stroke with an NIH stroke scale of 3 and getting 
better in the ER.
============

 2. CVA: Patient was diagnosed yesterday with resolving TIA. Presents today again 
with story of fall. ABCD2 score of 4 indicates a moderate ~4.1% risk of 
progression of TIA to stroke (score based on age >60, h/o speech impairment,
